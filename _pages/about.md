I am a Professional Masters student in Machine Learning at MILA, Universite de Montreal. I graduated in Electronics & Communications in 2015 and had been working in the industry for the past four years. I have worked on quite a number of Proof of concept (PoC) involving various sub-fields of AI like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge base etc.

My interests include CNN for vision tasks. Recently I acquired interest in the area of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Generative Modelling.
